This is ubf-eep8, a framework for integrating UBF and EEP8.  This
repository depends on the ubf open source repository.


Quick Start Recipe
==================

To download, build, and test the ubf_eep8 application in one shot,
please follow this recipe:

    $ mkdir working-directory-name
    $ cd working-directory-name
    $ git clone git://github.com/norton/ubf-eep8.git ubf_eep8
    $ cd ubf_eep8
    $ ./rebar get-deps
    $ ./rebar clean
    $ ./rebar compile
    $ ./rebar eunit

For an alternative recipe with other "features" albeit more complex,
please read further.


To download
===========

1. Configure your e-mail and name for Git

    $ git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
    $ git config --global user.name "Your Name"

2. Install Repo

    $ mkdir -p ~/bin
    $ wget -O - https://github.com/android/tools_repo/raw/master/repo > ~/bin/repo
    $ perl -i.bak -pe 's!git://android.git.kernel.org/tools/repo.git!git://github.com/android/tools_repo.git!;' ~/bin/repo
    $ chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

    CAUTION: Since access to kernel.org has been shutdown due to
    hackers, fetch and replace repo tool with android's GitHub
    repository mirror.

3. Create working directory

    $ mkdir working-directory-name
    $ cd working-directory-name
    $ repo init -u git://github.com/norton/manifests.git -m ubf-eep8-default.xml

    NOTE: Your "Git" identity is needed during the init step.  Please
    enter the name and email of your GitHub account if you have one.
    Team members having read-write access are recommended to use "repo
    init -u git@github.com:norton/manifests.git -m
    ubf-eep8-default-rw.xml".

    TIP: If you want to checkout the latest development version of UBF
    EEP8, please append " -b dev" to the repo init command.

4. Download Git repositories

    $ cd working-directory-name
    $ repo sync

To build - basic recipe
=======================

1. Get and install an erlang system
   http://www.erlang.org

2. Build UBF
   $ cd working-directory-name/src
   $ make compile

3. Run the unit tests
   $ cd working-directory-name/src
   $ make eunit


To build - optional features
============================

A. Dialyzer Testing _basic recipe_

   A.1. Build Dialyzer's PLT _(required once)_

   $ cd working-directory-name/src
   $ make build-plt

   TIP: Check Makefile and dialyzer's documentation for further
   information.

   A.2. Dialyze with specs

   $ cd working-directory-name/src
   $ make dialyze

   CAUTION: If you manually run dialyzer with the "-r" option, execute
   "make clean compile" first to avoid finding duplicate beam files
   underneath rebar's .eunit directory.  Check Makefile for further
   information.

   A.3. Dialyze without specs

   $ cd working-directory-name/src
   $ make dialyze-nospec


Documentation -- Where should I start?
======================================

This README is a good first step.  Check out and build using the "To
build" instructions above.

EEP8 samples and eunit tests can be found in the test/eunit directory.


What is UBF?
============

UBF is the "Universal Binary Format", designed and implemented by Joe
Armstrong.  UBF is a language for transporting and describing complex
data structures across a network.  It has three components:

   * UBF(A) is a "language neutral" data transport format, roughly
     equivalent to well-formed XML.

   * UBF(B) is a programming language for describing types in UBF(A)
     and protocols between clients and servers.  This layer is
     typically called the "protocol contract".  UBF(B) is roughly
     equivalent to Verified XML, XML-schemas, SOAP and WDSL.

   * UBF(C) is a meta-level protocol used between a UBF client and a
     UBF server.

See http://norton.github.com/ubf for further details.


What is EEP8?
=============

EEP8 is an extension to the Erlang language for declaring sets of
Erlang terms to form a particular type, effectively forming a specific
subtype of the set of all Erlang terms. Subsequently, these types can
be used to specify types of record fields and argument and return
values of functions.  See http://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0008.html for
full details.
